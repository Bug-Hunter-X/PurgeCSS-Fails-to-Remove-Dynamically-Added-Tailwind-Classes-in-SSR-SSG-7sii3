This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js that uses server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG).  The issue arises because Tailwind's purge feature, which removes unused CSS classes, might not correctly identify classes used dynamically on the client-side.  This can happen when the class names are generated at runtime, for instance through JavaScript manipulating DOM elements. For example, if you have a loop dynamically applying classes, those classes might not be purged, leading to bloated CSS. The purged output might miss the dynamically added classes, so Tailwind can't apply styles to the specific elements.
